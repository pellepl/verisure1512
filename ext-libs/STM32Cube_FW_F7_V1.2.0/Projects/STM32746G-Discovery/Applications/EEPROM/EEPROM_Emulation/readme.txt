@par Application Description 

This application shows how to emulate EEPROM on internal flash.

Please refer to $APPLICATION_NOTE$ for futher details regarding this application.


STM32746G-Discovery's LED can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is On when the example runs successfully.
  - LED1 is toggle in case of error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This application runs on STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32746G_DISCOVERY
    boards RevB and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
