@par Application Description

This example provides a description on how to use STM32Cube™ firmware with FatFs
middleware component as a generic FAT file system module. The objective is to develop an
application making the most of the features offered by FatFs to configure a microSD drive. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 216 MHz.

 - Link the uSD disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the uSD drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the uSD drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the uSD disk I/O driver.

It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs. Otherwise, user can check if the
written text file is available on the uSD card.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 
 
STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.
  
For more details about FatFs implementation on STM32Cube, please refer to UM1721 "Developing Applications 
on STM32Cube with FatFs".

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This application runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM327x6G_EVAL
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM327x6G_EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a uSD Card to the MSD connector (CN16).
    - Ensure that JP24 is in position 2-3 to use LED1.
    - Ensure that JP23 is in position 2-3 to use LED3. 
    


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
