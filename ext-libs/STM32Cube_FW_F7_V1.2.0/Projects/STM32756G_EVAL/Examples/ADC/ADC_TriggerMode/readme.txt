@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC3 and TIM2 to convert continuously data 
from ADC3 with channel ADC_CHANNEL_8.

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started by ADC3.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
  From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 216 MHz.
  2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 216 MHz.
  3) APB1 Prescaler = 4 => PCLK1 clock is 216 MHz/4.
  4) For Timer 2, as APB1 Prescaler = 4, Timer 2 Clock is PCLK1 clock X 2 = 216 MHz/2.

  For a 20 Khz frequency, we need (216 MHz/2) / 20 KHz = 5400 clock cycle.
  So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 5400;

The voltage on pin PF.10 (ADC_CHANNEL_8)can vary using the board potentiometer RV1.
The converted value is monitored through debugger: uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

The uhADCxConvertedValue read value is coded on 12 bits, the Vref+ reference voltage is connected 
on the board to VDD (+3.3V), the Vref- reference voltage is connected on the board to the ground.
To convert the read value in volts, here is the equation to apply :
Voltage = uhADCxConvertedValue * (Vref+ - Vref-) / (2^12) = uhADCxConvertedValue * 3.3 / 4096

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - STM327x6G-EVAL revB Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to  PF.10).
    - JP24 must be fitted in 1-2 positions
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
