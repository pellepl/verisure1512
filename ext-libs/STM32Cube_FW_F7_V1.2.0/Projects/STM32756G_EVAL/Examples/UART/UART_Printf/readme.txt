@par Example Description 

This example shows how to reroute the C library printf function to the UART. 
This implementation outputs the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USART1.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

Board: STM327x6G-EVAL revB
Tx Pin: PA.09
Rx Pin: PA.10

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F756xx/STM32F746xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM327x6G-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - STM32756G_EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN7 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP7 is on RS232_RX position.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
